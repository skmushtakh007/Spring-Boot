-> Spring provides @Controller annotation to make a java class as a Spring MVC controller.
   The @Controller annotation indicates that a particular class serves the role of a controller.
-> Controller in Spring MVC web application is a component that handles incoming HTTP requests.
-> @Controller annotation is simply a specialization of the @Component class, which allows us to auto-detect
   implementation classes through the classpath scanning.
-> We typically use @Controller in combination with a @RequestMapping annotation for request handling methods.
-> @ResponseBody:- @ResponseBody annotation is used to return http request to client.
   It internally uses spring provided http message convertor which convert message into json format.

-> @RequestMapping and @ResponseBody are handler methods
