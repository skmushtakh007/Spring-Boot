-> By default, spring creates all singleton beans eagerly at the startup/bootstrapping of the application context.
-> You can load the spring beans lazily (on-demand) using @Lazy annotation.
-> @Lazy annotation can be used with @Configuration, @Component and @Bean annotations.
-> Eager initialization is recommended: to avoid and detect all possible errors immediately rather than ar runtime.
